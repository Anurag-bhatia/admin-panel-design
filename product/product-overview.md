# Admin Panel

## Description
A B2B operations platform that manages the complete lifecycle of traffic challan resolution services for fleet operators and corporate clients. From lead acquisition and subscriber onboarding to challan processing, lawyer management, payments, and dispute resolution, Admin Panel replaces Excel-driven operations with an automated, auditable system that scales with volume while maintaining accuracy and accountability.

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: Manual tracking and Excel dependency
Every lead, subscriber, incident, payment, commission, and refund is tracked as a structured record with automated calculations, eliminating formula errors, version conflicts, and individual dependency that make scaling impossible.

### Problem 2: No SLA visibility or enforcement
Automatic SLA timers start at assignment, the system sends automated reminders to lawyers and internal teams, and breached cases are automatically reassigned—removing manual follow-ups and ensuring subscriber expectations are met.

### Problem 3: Fragmented workflow and lack of accountability
Complete audit trail across the entire customer and operations lifecycle—from lead conversion to dispute resolution—making every decision traceable, every partner and lawyer measurable, and every financial transaction auditable.
